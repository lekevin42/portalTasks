Task 2 was programmed in Python 3.5.1.

The calendar is structured using a list in a dictionary. And by using the date as the key and an event class to hold the data.
The event class has three attributes (eventName, date, and time).

The reason why I chose to use a dictionary is because we only have to check if the list is more than 1.
